After I've made my Encool generator some guy
have asked me why won't Encooler Russificate
what he types. Like turn English characters into
Russian symbols. The answer was obvious,
cause that's just not the way that I wanted my
Encooler to roll. Encooler was about making text
look cool using hell more symbols than just East
Slavic (Russian, Ukrainian, Rusyn, and
Belarusian). But I thought that if some people
look for this kind of generator - why not make
one? So I bring you here one more tool for text
Encooling. A tool for Slavication of your texts,
names and messages.'''
